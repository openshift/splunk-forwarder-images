=====================
THINGS YOU NEED TO DO
=====================
- Make sure the following line is in your base Makefile:

include boilerplate/generated-includes.mk

- Remove any other 'include' lines, unless they're for things truly
  unique to your repository. (Otherwise, consider proposing them to
  boilerplate.)

- Delete any obsolete files you're no longer including.

- Define a `make test` target for Prow

- Have a Dockerfile in ./build/Dockerfile and define IMAGE_NAME for it.
  Others container images can be specified with ADDITIONAL_IMAGE_SPECS
